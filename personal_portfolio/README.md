Website to showcase my contents

## Page Contents

### Landing Page

Start with bold name text, below that we will have a short description about me <br>
Below that we will have **Highlights** Section. This will have navbar to switch between the different categories such as
project, music. Each category will show few highlighted contents. A button saying "Show all". This will open up a new
view with all the highlighted contents. This button will not be present if the number of highlights are 4 or less. A
button saying "Show all project", "Show all music" will be present. This will forward them to my git or youtube, etc

Below that we will have posts/blogs section with similar structure But instead of having separate show project/ show
music button we will have a "Show all" button.

When we enter these contents they are going to be markdown language.
